This assignment felt sort of confusing because it seemed unclear what was on the procedural and what was in main. It was also confusing because there were lots of files to deal with which is new.

I am confident that my methods, constructor, and attributes are all there and they work, I just don't know what is happening with importing the files all of a sudden. It keeps telling me that the classes are not defined but they are. I even tried naming the files the same as the class to see if that worked but it didn't.

I plan to ask Jordan in class tomorrow what might be the issue with this.
I was feeling pretty good about it until the end, then I started to feel defeated and I cried a little bit. Just a little bit.

My advice for someone taking this course in the future would be knowing how to work your files and connect them before you start this assignment.

Once I was able to make my fixes, I felt much better about the assignment and saw my clear mistake when handling the files.
